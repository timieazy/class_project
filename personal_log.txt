Day 1 (28-01-2024)
so as instructed i installed gunicorn using "pip install Flask gunicorn"
am new to gunicorn, so decided to make some research and play with it for a bit to get a hang of it.
gunicorn- so i decided to just go ahead and input gunicorn and see what happens result... worker failed to boot.
gunicorn is seeming a bit complex...i'll continue in the morning

Day 2 (30-01-2024)
I proceed from last error...running gunicorn
this time around i seek the assistance of chatgpt "how to setup gunicorn for a Flask project"
i go a command "gunicorn -w 2 -b 127.0.0.1:5000 app:app"
-w = worker
-b= specified ip address and port
app:app=location of app.play, more like module_name:app_instance

honestly i still have no clue to what i am do at the moment 
but decided to forge ahead hopefully the answers would come.

Day 4 (2-2-2024)
After successfully completing the application desided to add some extras but many failed, want to enable mailling 
features, i noticed i dont always like sticking buy the book,in the case my actions were not need and 
unneccessary. Now am starting again

Day 5 (18-2-2024)
